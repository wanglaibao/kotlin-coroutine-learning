# How Kotlin Coroutine Works Under The Hood
```
    Kotlin Coroutine is a great and powerful language feature

    that’s why I think introduce coroutines is necessary
```

### Brief Intro On Kotlin Coroutine

```
Kotlin coroutine is a way of doing things asynchronously in a sequential manner.

Creating a coroutine is a lot cheaper vs creating a thread.

        “In Kotlin Coroutine Structure Of [Imperative], Synchronous Code is the same as Asynchronous Code.”

                                                                                    By Venkat Subramariam
```

```
    In Kotlin,async and await are not  keywords, but merely functions.

    This design allows the integration of different asynchronous APIs: futures/promises, callback-passing, etc.

    It is also general enough to express lazy generators (yield) and cover some other use cases.
